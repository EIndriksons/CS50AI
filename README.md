# Harvard CS50AI Solutions and Lecture files

The following files are my solutions to the Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course on [edX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/course/) and are to be used only to showcase my portfolio to potential employers, universities or other entities.

If you are a student of this course - please see the Course guidelines on [Academic Honesty](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/syllabus.html#academic-honesty) and try to complete this course by yourself. I can guarantee that investing your time and energy into solving these problems yourself is the only way to properly master the subject of this course.
